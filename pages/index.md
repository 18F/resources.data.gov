# Enterprise data resources

Resources.data.gov is intended to assist federal agencies in making available
and accessible as much data as possible by providing a central location for
statutes, policies, guidance, and tools on open data.

This website is an effort by the Office of Management and Budget, the
Office of Government Information Services of the National Archives, and the
General Services Administration to provide an online repository of guidance and
tools to implement the OPEN Government Data Act and make federal data as
accessible and usable as possible. The repository will be frequently updated
with additional tools and resources and will be developed in an
open, collaborative manner and welcome suggestions from the public.

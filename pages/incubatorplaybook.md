## Opportunity Descriptions  <a name="opportunity-descriptions"></a>

*KEY*
* The Opportunity – Proposed opportunity
* Elements: Requirements – Operators, players, open data, and agreements
* Finding Success – Usefulness of the proposed opportunity
* Proof Points: Evidence and Example – Setting of past successes
* Getting Started – Enhancing and re-forming the use of Federal Data by expanding alliances and partnerships

<hr>

### 10x Process <a name="10x-process"></a>  <a href="#decision-table">↑</a>  
*The OPPORTUNITY*  
10x provides start-up funding for new technology projects and products across government. It aims to uncover and elevate the most promising ideas from the Federal workforce. 10x is a program that lives within the  Technology Transformation Services (TTS), and is managed by the Office of Products and Programs of the General Services Administration. TTS manages the Digital Services Fund. 10x starts their funding small and increase their investment as an idea matures into a sustainable project. 10x accepts ideas from Federal employees throughout the year. A few times a year, 10x collects all the ideas and evaluates them for funding. The most promising ideas proceed to Phase 1.
  
*ELEMENTS: Requirements*  
The idea will be evaluated based on the following three criteria, each given equal weight:
Clarity: The idea is no more than three sentences long and it explains a real problem. 
Alignment: The idea must help develop new, good-for-government technology and improve the public’s experience with government through technology. 
Impact: Solving this problem will have an important effect on the Federal government or the public.
  
*FINDING SUCCESS*  
Past projects include the U.S. Web Design Systems, Federalist, and the TTS Bug Bounty Programs.
  
*PROOF POINTS: Evidence and Examples*  
Federal Grantee Reporting
This project will identify opportunities to improve the Federal grant reporting process, by eliminating redundancies and creating efficiencies through improved technology — with the goal of generating a prototype that could be adapted across Federal programs, thereby increasing Federal grant programs’ efficacy to those being served as well as taxpayers’ return on investment.
  
*PRA.Gov*  
OMB’s Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) is charged with overseeing Federal compliance with the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA). Agencies often cite frustration with accessing and understanding OMB’s policies on the PRA, which are spread across numerous inaccessible PDFs. This situation has reduced compliance and created delays in the approval of information collection requests (ICRs). Through outreach to PRA desk officers and agency staff, and in consultation with OIRA, TTS will explore what it would take to modernize the way agencies interact with OMB’s policies in order to design an accessible, user-friendly online interface to respond to agency inquiries.
  
*GETTING STARTED*  
Pitch an idea. https://10x.gsa.gov/send-us-an-idea/  Use their Google form (online form) –  https://10x.gsa.gov  the google form  https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdJJXKYxW8PERXJ_33oHB1JqUB4wBomHiwM8B7nnYdgyjW2bQ/viewform  or email them directly at 10x@gsa.gov  
Visit this site for more info https://10x.gsa.gov/the-10x-process/
  
### 18F <a name="18f"></a>  <a href="#decision-table">↑</a>  
*The OPPORTUNITY*  
18F helps agencies move paper processes online, increase data access, save millions of dollars on cloud hosting, and implement new acquisition techniques. 18F is an office of Federal employees, within the General Services Administration (GSA), collaborating with other agencies to fix technical problems, build products, and improve how government serves the public through technology. 18F is part of the Technology Transformation Services, within the Federal Acquisition Service. 
  
*ELEMENTS: Requirements*  
18F partners with civilian and military Federal agencies to help you build or buy exceptional digital services.
18F works with partners who have Federal funding, and, as a cost recoverable office, they are required to charge for their work. 
18F also offers procurement services to state and local governments with access to Federal funds.  
  
*FINDING SUCCESS*  
18F delivers websites, applications, and strategies to help agencies provide excellent value to public. The Federal Election Commission (FED) found success with their brand new website at FEC.gov. “We engaged with 18F, and it was a game-changer for us. They came in and helped the IT team and business owners get involved in the agile development process. It changed our whole methodology. - Alec Palmer, FEC’s Chief Information Officer”
  
*PROOF POINTS: Evidence and Examples*  
The Contract-Awarded Labor Category (CALC) tool
In May, 18F and GSA’s Professional Services Category launched CALC, a powerful labor category and pricing research tool to help the Federal contracting community make smarter, faster buying decisions. CALC helps contracting officers determine the range of pricing at the highest level for a specific labor category across a database of contract awarded prices for 48,000 labor categories from more than 5,000 recent GSA contracts. The tool saved Federal contracting officers and the cities time and money. 
  
*New website at FEC.gov*  
The Federal Election Commission (FEC) new website at FEC.gov is the result of a years-long collaboration with GSA’s 18F and features completely revamped tools for exploring campaign finance data. It provides user-centered content for understanding the reporting and compliance requirements for people participating in Federal elections, redesigned tools for exploring legal resources, and more. 
  
*GETTING STARTED*  
Email Kenny Daniel on their Agency Partnerships team to see if 18F can help your agency. For all inquiries, you can reach their outreach team at 18F@gsa.gov

### Administrative Data Research Facility <a name="adrf"></a>  <a href="#decision-table">↑</a>  
*The OPPORTUNITY*  
NYU’s Administrative Data Research Facility (ADRF) is a secure cloud environment for hosting both confidential micro-data and analytics tools. Through a combination of data sharing agreements and trainings, the ADRF is evolving the empirical foundation of social science, statistical, and public agencies in the United States, in turn transforming our understanding of how society works.
  
*ELEMENTS: Requirements*  
The ADRF allows agencies within the same state or different states to agree to share their data in a common area in the cloud for specific approved projects. If approved, staff from multiple agencies can jointly access the common area, so that they can work together to develop new integrated datasets, share information about coding differences or similarities, and develop common measures. No personally identifiable information is stored in the cloud. The data are hashed and de-identified (with a common hash algorithm) before being transferred to the secure area. Moreover, data stewardship modules can be deployed so that agencies can track data use and work output. 
  
*FINDING SUCCESS*  
The ADRF has hosted almost 50 confidential government datasets from 12 different agencies at all levels of government. Over 175 agency staff, from about 50 agencies, have already accessed and used the ADRF. The ADRF has received Authorization to Operate from the Census Bureau, has achieved a FedRAMP Moderate approval, and is listed on the FedRAMP Marketplace. 
  
*PROOF POINTS: Evidence and Examples*  
RICH CONTEXT COMPETITION (2019)
All too often, organizations provide data to the public without any way to track its use, and therefore the value of making those data available. Furthermore, researchers have a hard time determining what data has proved helpful to previous projects pursuing related research questions. The goal of this competition was to automate the discovery of research datasets and the associated research methods and fields in social science research publications. Participants used any combination of machine learning and data analysis methods to identify the datasets used in a corpus of social science publications and infer both the scientific methods and fields used in the analysis and the research fields. All submitted algorithms will be made publicly available as open source tools.
  
*GETTING STARTED*  
Contacting their Slack team is one method of communication for their Applied Data Analytics program. They include channels for programming specific issues (for example Python and SQL, training program specific topics, and general discussion. Contact Information POC: Julia Lane at fedramp-adrf@nyu.edu .

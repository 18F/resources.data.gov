  **USDA FNS** uses ReVAL to implement their Data Validation Service tool for
  validating data from FNS-742 form submissions. Each year state agencies report
  these data for each School Food Authority (SFA) with schools operating the
  National School Lunch Programs (NSLP) and/or the School Breakfast Program
  (SBP). Read more about their work in this [case study from the Federal Data
  Strategy](https://strategy.data.gov/proof-points/2019/05/17/supercharging-data-through-validation-as-a-service/).


  The **Census Bureau** uses ReVAL to explore an implementation to check
  Commodity Flow Survey (CFS) Data. These CFS data are used by policy makers and
  transportation planners in various federal, state, and local agencies for
  assessing the demand for transportation facilities and services, energy use,
  and safety risk and environmental concerns.


  The **Department of Transportation** uses ReVAL to validate Work Zone Data by
  validating it against the Work Zone Data Exchange (WZDx) Specification. The
  Work Zone Data Exchange (WZDx) Specification enables infrastructure owners and
  operators (IOOs) to make harmonized work zone data available for third party
  use. The intent is to make travel on public roads safer and more efficient
  through ubiquitous access to data on work zone activity. Specifically, the
  project aims to get data on work zones into vehicles to help automated driving
  systems (ADS) and human drivers navigate more safely.

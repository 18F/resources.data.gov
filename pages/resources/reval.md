  **Example 1: Saving time and improving data quality for the National School
  Lunch & Breakfast Program**


  **USDA FNS** uses ReVal to implement their Data Validation Service tool for
  validating data from FNS-742 form submissions. Each year state agencies report
  these data for each School Food Authority (SFA) with schools operating the
  National School Lunch Programs (NSLP) and/or the School Breakfast Program
  (SBP). Read more about their work in this [case study from the Federal Data
  Strategy](https://strategy.data.gov/proof-points/2019/05/17/supercharging-data-through-validation-as-a-service/).


  In March 2020, the first states to pilot FNS's instantiation of ReVal reported
  on its perceived benefits:“We had a reduction in errors from 96 last year to 2
  this year. In terms of time, that’s days of work. It used to take at least one
  person a week—40 hours—to get all the data back fixed.”


  > * “In the past I would have run the data \[to prepare it for submission] 6-8
  times. … This year I ran it twice.”

  > * “The benefit to my site is it flags the warnings before we upload the data
  to FPRS so we already have the information and data we need. … I used to have
  to track what errors were appearing when I uploaded to FPRS—but now I don’t
  have to do that anymore, which is amazing… we’re skipping an entire
  back-and-forth now.”

  > * “Having the results and knowing what warnings are going to be—so I can
  have the explanations for those things ready to go—saved time and also lowered
  our stress level so, so, so much. … It even helped us find a few small bugs in
  our system because we knew what to expect.”


  **Example 2: Streamlining internal processes at the Census Bureau**


  The **Census Bureau** uses ReVal to explore an implementation to check
  Commodity Flow Survey (CFS) Data. These CFS data are used by policy makers and
  transportation planners in various federal, state, and local agencies for
  assessing the demand for transportation facilities and services, energy use,
  and safety risk and environmental concerns.


  **Example 3: Facilitating the adoption of a new data specification with the
  U.S. Department of Transportation**


  The **Department of Transportation** uses ReVal to validate Work Zone Data by
  validating it against the Work Zone Data Exchange (WZDx) Specification. The
  Work Zone Data Exchange (WZDx) Specification enables infrastructure owners and
  operators (IOOs) to make harmonized work zone data available for third party
  use. The intent is to make travel on public roads safer and more efficient
  through ubiquitous access to data on work zone activity. Specifically, the
  project aims to get data on work zones into vehicles to help automated driving
  systems (ADS) and human drivers navigate more safely.

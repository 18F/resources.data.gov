description: "Summary: In 2008, the Disaster Assistance Improvement Program (DAIP),\
  \ an E-Government initiative led by FEMA with support from 16 U.S. Government partners,\
  \ launched DisasterAssistance.gov to simplify the process for disaster survivors\
  \ to identify and apply for disaster assistance. DAIP utilized existing partner\
  \ technologies and implemented a services oriented architecture (SOA) that integrated\
  \ the content management system and rules engine supporting Department of Labor\u2019\
  s Benefits.gov applications with FEMA\u2019s Individual Assistance Center application.\
  \ The FEMA SOA serves as the backbone for data sharing interfaces with three of\
  \ DAIP\u2019s federal partners and transfers application data to reduce duplicate\
  \ data entry by disaster survivors. "

description: "Summary: The U.S. Department of Labor sought to go beyond merely making\
  \ data available to developers and take ease of use of the data to the next level\
  \ by giving developers tools that would make using DOL\u2019s data easier.  DOL\
  \ created software development kits (SDKs), which are downloadable code packages\
  \ that developers can drop into their apps, making access to DOL\u2019s data easy\
  \ for even the most novice developer. These SDKs have even been published as open\
  \ source projects with the aim of speeding up their conversion to SDKs that will\
  \ eventually support all federal APIs."

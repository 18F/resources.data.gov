description: "The Census Bureau team produced a new interactive mapping tool in early\
  \ 2018 called the Response Outreach Area Mapper (ROAM), an application that resulted\
  \ in wider use of authoritative Census Bureau data, not only to improve the Census\
  \ Bureau\u2019s own operational efficiency, but also for use by tribal, state, and\
  \ local governments, national and local partners, and other community groups. Other\
  \ agency data practitioners can learn from the Census Bureau team\u2019s experience\
  \ communicating technical needs to non-technical executives, building analysis tools\
  \ with widely-used software, and integrating efforts with stakeholders and users."

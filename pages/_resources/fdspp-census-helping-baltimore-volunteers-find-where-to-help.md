description: "Bloomberg Government analysts put together a prototype through the Census\
  \ Bureau\u2019s Opportunity Project to better assess where volunteers should direct\
  \ litter-clearing efforts. Using Census Bureau and Forest Service information, the\
  \ team brought a data-driven approach to their work. Their experience reveals how\
  \ individuals with data expertise can identify a real-world problem that data can\
  \ help solve, navigate across agencies to find and obtain the most useful data,\
  \ and work within resource constraints to provide a tool to help address the problem."
